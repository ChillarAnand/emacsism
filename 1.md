# Why This Book?

It has been almost 60 years(Emacs is originally written in 1976) since emacs came into picture and yet none of the latest & advanced softwares weren't able to replace emacs. There is something magnificient about emacs by which it is able to draw users to use it, develop it further and form a cult around it through out all these years. It is one of the longest lived programming applications of all time. 


You might have heard/read a lot of flattery about emacs. If you try and learn emacs for a while(may be few weeks to few months), you will realize that the flattery is actually true and everything you have read is very less when compared to what emacs is actually capable of.


Since mastering emacs takes a considerable amount of time, you might need some strong reasons to use emacs. Also if You are trying to figure out whether to go for emacs or use any other softwares, You need a summary of the advantages of emacs or practical benefits of using emacs. 


This little book is to created exactly for that purpose. This book explains fundamentals(not basics) of emacs, what made emacs different from other editors, debunk few popular myths about emacs and finally how to learn emacs without leaving emacs. Explaining how to use emacs is beyond the scope of this book.


If you are just looking for a piece of software which has features like syntax highligthing, autocompletion, debuggers e.t.c., which help to write & execute code, you can stop here and go for an IDE. If You are not satisfied with that, if you need something much simpler yet more powerful than IDE's and if you are looking for a divine editing experience, emacs might help you!


# Cautions


## About Emacs:

I see emacs as an inward spiral. Once you start learning emacs and realize the
power of emacs, you start spending more and more time within emacs and it gets
impossible to get out of emacs. You have been warned!!


## About Book:

I am neither a professional writer nor an expert in emacs. I just tried to put my thoughts about emacs on a paper. When I got struct in explaining something, I copied some ideas from few blog posts. Any mistakes are my own.

# My Experience With Emacs


I was using PHP for server side programming & I was looking for a good IDE. I tried Sublime text, Eclipse & Vim for a while and settled for Vim. 


After a year or so, I switched from PHP to Python. I found quite a few people in Python community were using something called Emacs.


I started digging about emacs and came across editor war. There were few articles which supported vim and mentioned why vim is better than emacs in many aspects. So I was thought vim is much better than emacs. Even if you look at statistics vim is quite popular than emacs. In addition to that I have already spent a year learning & customising vim. So I wasn't ready to switch.


Even though emacs had a small user base, one thing started to bother me. In my interaction with emacs users, i have  found that emacs has some kind of cult following. Not even a single user is ready to give up emacs at any cost even though emacs can't provide some features that are provided by most of modern IDE's.


So I decided to try it out for a few weeks and figure out myself what's so great about emacs and see how it goes. For a couple of weeks I have used it almost like a notepad. I started learning elisp & customising emacs little bit. After a couple of months I was suprised when I realized that I was spending almost all the time in emacs itself.


# Lisp



Emacs is written in a programming language called emacs-lisp(a variant of lisp). There were some attempts to port emacs to other languages. But none of them were successful because those programming languages weren't as powerful as lisp. Before diving into the emacs, it is good to have a brief introduction to Lisp and see  how it differs from traditional languages (like C, Python, Java e.t.c).

### Lists

Lisp might seem like a strange(?) programming language with parentheses everywhere. Lists are basis of lisp. a list looks like this

>    (lisp elisp python c c++)

The individual elements are called atoms. They are seperated by white space and held together by parentheses.



### Expressions
     
Lisp is an expression-oriented programming language which means almost everything is an expression. For example, adding `x` and greatest of `y`, `z`, can be done with a single expression

    (if (> y z) (+ x y) (+ x z))
    
That might look bit odd because lisp uses prefix notation.

In a traditional programming language(like Python) it is not possible to do that in a single expression.

    (x + (if y > z: y else: z))

Because they distinguish statements and expressions and a conditional statement(`if y>z: y else: z`) can't be used inside an expression(`(x + something)`).

What's more interesting is, in Lisp, it is possible to compose expressions in many ways.

The above expression

    (if (> y z) (+ x y) (+ x z))

Can also be written as

    (+ x (if (> y z) y z))

Lisp by making everything an expression expands possibilites to combine parts of language in unusual ways.


### Availability

Traditional programming language have read time, compile time & run time. In Lisp, the whole language always available. There is no real distinction between read-time, compile-time, and runtime. You can compile or run code while reading, read or run code while compiling, and read or compile code at runtime.


### Extensibility

If 

Macro is a piece of code which treats code as data and generates new code. Macros will be used by compiler to generate code that will be compiled just before its evaluation.



extending the compiler--you're telling the parser how to recognize a new construct, to change the grammar of the language, and also specifying how to generate code for the new construct. This is something you can't do in most language

# Why Emacs?

In this chapter, I will explain few emacs features by comparing Emacs with other editors/IDE's. This is just to have better understanding of emacs fundamental features. However note that Emacs is not just a text editor but it is an extensible computing environment where as most editors/IDE's are just editors/IDE's.


## Real Estate

If you look at typical IDE, its layout looks like this.

Some IDE's have more components than this. Here is the screenshot of emacs as I am writing this book.

Pretty neat, huh? Since it is completely distraction less, You can visually concentrate on getting things done :D


## Buffers

Most IDE's use tabs to hold files when a file is opened. One serious disadvantage is it doesn't scale well. If You open more than 10 files, the bar that shows file names will get clogged. It becomes quite difficult to switch between files.

Emacs uses something called "buffer" to hold files/text. Every time a file is opened or a process is started, a buffer is used to hold text. Buffers can scale to any extent. You can open million files at a time and You can switch to any file with just few key presses.


## Extensibility

Extensibility lies at the heart of emacs. What I mean by extensibility is

* end user should be able to change any piece of editor
* editor should have the ability to add new functionality, without affecting its internal structure and data flow

For example, most editors have fuzzy search to find files in a project. Fuzzy search is awesome. If you have several projects, it would be great if you could fuzzy search project names also. If You are not using emacs, try to implement this in Your editor and see how it goes. In Emacs, it is as easy as calling an existing function with a different variable. Same thing applies to most other features also. With few lines of code, You can customize/extend it, the way you want it. 


## Composability

Composability refers to inter-relationships of components. In Emacs, every component can be selected and assembled in various combinations as per user requirements.

If we take previous example of fuzzy search, most editors combine two pieces to achieve it. They combine `fuzzy search` code with `open file` code. So you can `search` for a file and then press enter which `opens` the file. Now instead of `opening` the file, lets say you have to `rename` it or `delete` it. Its not possible.

In emacs, once you `searched` for a file, you can perform any action on it. You can open it, rename it, delete it or You can define Your own function to do something else. This composability helps a lot to either modify existing features or define new features with very few lines of code.



## DWIM

Emacs has quite a few DWIM(Do What I Mean) functions. These functions will try to do the right thing instead of blindly executing user's input by programmatically responding to past actions and document state. This reduces number of keystrokes a user has to use for a particular task.

For example, if cursor is at code and if I execute the function comment-dwim-2 twice, it tries to insert an inline comment. On the other hand, if I call the function once, go around the file, comeback and call the function again, it uncomments the line instead of inserting an inline comment.



## Replication

To customize an IDE, You have to clicking menus/checkboxes. If you are using IDE, you might also need terminal or terminal multiplexer. You might have some custom configuration for terminals tool. You might even need some other third party tools for Your development environment.

Consider some situation where You have to

* reinstall your OS
* using multiple machines for development
* using friends system for some bug fixing or development

In these situations, you need a lot of time just to replicate Your development environment.

To customize emacs, You have to write some code instead of clicking menus/checkboxes. You can keep your dot files in version control. In above situations I have mentioned, replicating your environment is as easy as cloning your emacs config and restarting emacs. You can replicate your development environment in just few minutes.
# Why Editor War Is Stupid

Both emacs and vim has cult following and they are the longest lived programming applications of all time. Both groups insist that their editor is best. This has led to many flame wars and lots of jokes about both.

Vim is a superior editor and is far better than many editors out there. Most of the systems have vim pre-installed and You can use Vim with same commands on any system. You can quickly open a file, make bunch of changes and close it.

Eventhough emacs is commonly known as text editor, it an extensible computing environment. It is an extensible editor. So You can use emacs as

Mail Client

Document Viewer

Twitter Client

Irc Client

Web Browser

Video Editor

Blog Editor

Paint

Spreadsheet

Todo List

Wiki

Translator

Terminal Multiplexer
 
SSH Client

Slides Editor

Stack Exchange client

Playing Games

Version Control Interface

Web server

Lisp Interpreter

SQL client

and also writing, compiling & debugging code & thousands of other things.

Basically, You will keep it open 24/7 and live inside it.

I think comparing both of them is kind of stupid. If we want to compare tow things, they have to be atleast in the same category. There is no point in comparing a banana and a chicken.

# Escaping Meta Alt Control Shift

> An old joke: Emacs stands for "Escape Meta Alt Control Shift."

> Emacsism: Emacs stands for "Escaping Meta Alt Control Shift."

One of major problems with emacs is that users need to use modifier keys[Shift, Ctrl,  Alt/Meta, Super] repetetively. If we look at the key board layout, `Ctrl` is placed at the corners. `Ctrl` is the most used modifier key in emacs. Everytime we  need to press it, we have to stretch our little finger all the way to the corner or move the hand, both of them are not ergonomic/convinient.

To avoid that problem, it is a customary practice to bind caps lock to ctrl. this solves the problem to an extent. If I have to press `C-c C-e`, I have to hold `caps lock` with little finger, and then press `c` & `e` with any remaining fingers. An alternate solution is to use `right control key` with right little finger and press `c` & `e` which takes back to the previous problem. Also if we look at strength of our fingers, thumb stands and the top, little finger at bottom and remaining fingers somewhere in the middle. So binding caps lock to control doesn't solve the problem ergonomically.

## Escaping Ctrl:

one of the mind blowing idea that solves this problem is using space as space and ctrl. Yes, you read it correctly. There some packages that modify space to act as space if you press it and leave & it will act as ctrl if you press and hold it. This might seem bizzare at first but once you get used to the idea, it feels real good. Once you do this, there is no need to touch ctrl key in your life time.

## Escaping Shift:

Lets look at some common situations where we use shift most and how to avoid it emacs.

### Special characters:

the usage of symbols is more than that of numbers in programming(atleast for me).if you are using emacs for programming, you can use this snippet to interchange symbols and numbers. also you can use numeric keypad for numbers.

    (defun switch-numbers-symbols ()
      "Bind symbols to digits."
      (interactive)
      (define-key key-translation-map (kbd "!") (kbd "1"))
      (define-key key-translation-map (kbd "@") (kbd "2"))
      (define-key key-translation-map (kbd "#") (kbd "3"))
      (define-key key-translation-map (kbd "$") (kbd "4"))
      (define-key key-translation-map (kbd "%") (kbd "5"))
      (define-key key-translation-map (kbd "^") (kbd "6"))
      (define-key key-translation-map (kbd "&") (kbd "7"))
      (define-key key-translation-map (kbd "*") (kbd "8"))
      (define-key key-translation-map (kbd "(") (kbd "9"))
      (define-key key-translation-map (kbd ")") (kbd "0")))
   (switch-numbers-symbols)
    
### Capitalize words:

if you are writing a book or documenting something, you need to capitalize words after a sentence/paragraph, always capitilize few characters/words. You can use auto capitalize package mode which automatically does that for you.

* Casing words:
based on the programming language, you have to case the identifiers(as per language - snake case for python, camel case for java, capitalized keywords for SQL). Emacs has a package called electric-case which automatically does that for you. If you are using emacs for SQL database access, there is a package called sql-up mode, which automatically upcases SQL keywords.


## Escaping Meta/Alt

I don't see any problem with using meta. However if you are willing to rebind, you can do it. Most of the times meta is used only to invoke `M-x`. There is a package called [key-chord](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/key-chord.el) which lets you to rebind any key combination to any two keys pressed automatically. So you can rebind `M-x` to `m-x`.

I do recommend using key-chord, to rebind most used key bindings. It saves a lot of key presses, instead of typing `C-c C-p r` everytime, you can just press `p-r`(or any other keys which feel intuitive for you).

Whatever I have explained so far is emacs part of less-keys project. Less-keys is a project I have started to minimize the number of keys and key presses to interact with computer.

# Emacs Singularity

Lets try to understand the power of selection narrowing first and then we will see how it becomes even more powerful with singularity.


## Selection Narrowing

> Autocompletion is dead. Welcome to selection narrowing.

One of the thing that blew my mind is `helm`. Helm is selection narrowing framework for Emacs. It steers users in the right direction as you type something. It takes away auto completion, so it will take some time to get used to the idea. 


Let us consider a folder called `emacsism` which is present in `/home/anand/projects/books/lisp/emacs/`. If I want to go to that directory using a bash shell, I have to type `cd /home/anand/projects/books/lisp/emacs/emacsism`. It will be difficult since I have to type such a long path. It even becomes annoying if I have to type it everytime I have to go to that directory.


Some smart people have developed plugins likes `jump`. By installing this plugin, I can run `j emacsism` which takes me directly to that directory. What this plugin does is, it keeps a track of all directories I have visited and when you type some name, it tries to narrow down options based on the name I have given. So instead of typing `j emacsism` I can just type `j ism` which takes me to `emacsism` as `ism` is unique to that directory. Thus selection narrowing tries to narrow down all available options based on user input.


This selection narrowing greatly improves productivity. However the method explained above is NOT interactive. Consider a case where you have two directories `emacsism1` and `emacsism2`. Now if I run `j ism` it will take me to most visited of `emacsism1` & `emacsism2`. Also if I have to visit a new directory, I have to type the complete path.


On the other other hand emacs selection narrowing is interactive. Lets see, how to change directory in emacs. I will call a command which is responsible for changing directories, by default it shows all the options so that I can navigate through them. If I type `i`, it narrows all the directories whose path has `i` in them. If I type `ism`, it filters down to two directories `emacsism1` & `emacsism2`. Thus by having interactive selection narrowing, helm makes it possible to steer in the right direction.


Selection narrowing is not just limited to switching directories in emacs. You can use it for anything.

If you have opened lot of files, just by typing a few characters, you can open that file.

Emacs has lots of commands. Some of them have keybindings. Most of them wont have keybindings. So selection narrowing can be used to narrow down commands.

If you have bookmarked lots of urls in your browser, you can do selection narrowing on them from emacs and when you select one, it will automatically takes you to browser with that page opened.

If you have starred thousands or repositories in github, you can do selection narrowing on them too.

You can define your own commands which does selection narrowing on any items you want and this can be done with just one line of code.


#### Emacs Singularity

> `Emacs singularity` is a hypothetical function, which is capable of doing anything!!

Lets see how some general actions that are performed in emacs.

If I want to activate a mode, I have to run `M-x <mode-name>`.

If I want to switch from one buffer to another, I have to run `M-x switch-to-buffer <buffer-name>`. Since `switch-to-buffer` function is binded to `C-x b`, I can run `C-x b <buffer-name>`.

If I want to go to a file called `test.py` in some project, I have to run `M-x projectile-find-file <file-name>` or `C-c p f <file-name>`.

If I want to install a package in emacs, I have to run `M-x package-install <package-name>`.


So most functions are invoked with `M-x <command-name>` or using a keybinding for that function. Then required arguments are passed to the function to perform some action.

Performing actions like this has some limitations.

* I have to remember quite a few keybindings.
* If I want to troubleshoot something in others emacs, I don't know key bindings for that configuration.
* Its not possible to interchange order of command name and arguments.


Now, lets how above actions can be performed with Singularity. Since I have bounded singularity to `fj` keys, I can invoke singularity by pressing `f` & `j` simultaneously.

If I want to activate a mode, I have to run `fj <mode-name>`.

If I want to switch from one buffer to another, I have to run `fj <buffer-name>`.

If I want to go to a file called `test.py` in some project, I have to run `singulariy <file-name>`.

If I want to install a package in emacs, I have to run `fj package-install <package-name>`. Since singularity uses helm, I dont need to type entire command name. Commands will be narrowed down to `package-install` after typing just a few characters.

Since singularity is capable of doing anything, it becomes much easier to interact with emacs.


Sometimes it will be much easier to specify argument to a command first and then specify command name. For example, if I have opened a file called `test.py`, it will be opened in a buffer called `test.py`. Lets say I am in some other buffer and I want to switch back to `test.py` buffer, I have to run `M-x switch-to-buffer test.py`. After typing `M-x switch-to-buffer tes`, I have realized that buffer was killed. Now I need to cancel this command and I have to use `M-x projectile-find-file test.py` to open `test.py` file. On the other hand I could have typed argument to a function first which is `test.py` and then if buffer is present I can run `switch-to-buffer` or if it is not present I could run `projectile-find-file`.

# Why Use Emacs For Everything?

Some people use emacs as just an IDE.

As explained in Chapter 3, emacs can be used for all sorts of things. There are many advantages of using emacs everywhere. Lets see some examples to understand why it be beneficial.

Task 1: Write a python script to update table in MySQL.

Without Emacs: For writing Python code, I will be using IDE. Sine I dont know how to update table in MySQL, I have to open browser, go to stackoverflow, search for it and find relevant code. Then open a terminal, create a mysql process and test the query. Once I know that is working fine, I have to go back to editor and use that query in script.

With Emacs: Emacs has stackexchange client. So I can search for something in stack exchange websites from emacs. When I get the results, I can select relevant code and then send that directly to MySQL process which is running in Emacs. If that code works, I can go to python script file and use it.

There is no need to switch between various applications as I can do most of the things in Emacs.


Task 2: Play `the  dark knight` movie from `/home/anand/videos/movies/english/dark-knight/`


Without Emacs: First I have to open a file manager, then navigate to corresponding path, and double click the video file. This video will be opened in some media player.

With Emacs: Since I am using singularity, if I just press `fj drk`, emacs shows me with the relevant video file `dark-knight.mkv`. Now if I just press enter, it will open in a media player.

By using emacs I will be able to access any file in the operating system with very little effort.


Task 3: Indent code while creating a github issue.

Without Emacs: While creating a github issue if I want a piece of text to be recognised as code, I need to do proper indentation. So I have to manually indent those lines. Alternatively, I can copy that text to IDE, indent there and then copy back.

Emacs has a package which provides an interface to edit text areas directly in emacs. So, I by calling a single function, I can easily format code part.

Since emacs acts as an interface, I will have entire power of emacs for any task.



These are just a few examples. You can checkout wide variety of packages available for various things for more.
